# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise, a hopeful playwright, is looking for insight about what makes Kickstarter campaigns successful and unsuccessful. From the initial crowdfunding data provided, we were able to sort and filter the data down to what would be most applicable to Louise. After looking at the data from several angles that would satisfy Louise's needs, we were able to provide useful analysis based on a variety of key factors. The purpose of this analysis is to gain an understanding of factors that contribute to a Kickstarter campaign's success or failure. More importantly, the purpose of this analyisis is to provide Louise with a clear understanding of what she needs to do in order to maximiize the potential of her Kickstarter campaign so that her play is fully funded. The two factors that she is most interested in are fundraising goals and launch dates so dove into the outcomes of campaigns for plays based on those two factors.
